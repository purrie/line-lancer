Minimalistic strategy game with goal of capturing islands. Direct your army to conquer opponent's territory until you're the last one on the map.

* Game Mechanics
The game is played with just the mouse by selecting which regions your army will move towards. Your focus is to choose which type of units to build and where to direct them. Your warriors will act and fight your opponents and capture land on their own.

* Installation
** Windows
The game can be run as is with no installation steps. Unpack the archive and play.

** Linux
Game build comes with install script which will put the game in appropriate directories according to XDG specification.

** Android
Apk file can be copied over to a phone and installed manually with no extra steps.

* Building
All of the game's dependencies are embedded within the project and don't require any external libraries to be installed. Building for Android requires SDK and NDK to be installed on your system. You can use [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Android-(on-Linux)][this]] guide as to how to do it. Build script expects ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK environment variables to be set to paths where each was installed.

The project uses make for build system. Recipes are only tested on GNU/Linux system and may not be suitable for usage on other systems.

To build the game, enter project's root directory and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make build
#+END_SRC
The following command will also automatically execute the game.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make run
#+END_SRC

Following commands will go through building and packing the game for all supported systems
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make pack-windows
make pack-linux
make pack-android
#+END_SRC
Resulting archives will be inside "pack" directory.
